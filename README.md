# Find files with Linux commands

## Objective

This lab aims to enhance proficiency in navigating the Linux file system and analyzing file contents. By practicing essential commands like pwd, ls, cd, and head, it will enhance the development of the skills necessary to effectively investigate security incidents and gather critical information from remote systems.

## Project description

This project focuses on navigating a Linux file system using command-line tools. By practicing basic Linux commands, the goal is to enhance skills in locating, accessing, and analyzing file content. The specific tasks involve navigating directories, listing files, and reading file contents. This knowledge is critical for security analysts who often need to remotely investigate systems and analyze logs.

## Skills Learned

### Linux Command-Line Navigation:

* **Navigating the File System:** The ability to use commands like cd to move between directories and pwd to display the current working directory.
* **Listing Files and Directories:** Using ls to list files and directories, and ls -la for a more detailed listing, including hidden files and permissions.

### File Manipulation:

* **Reading File Contents:** Using cat to display the entire contents of a file or head to display the first few lines.
* **Searching File Content:** Employing commands like grep to search for specific patterns within files.

### Understanding File Permissions:

* Interpreting file permissions displayed in ls -la output to understand who can read, write, and execute files and directories.

## Tools Used

* **Linux Terminal:** The primary tool used to interact with the Linux system and execute commands.
* **Basic Linux Commands:** Commands like `pwd`, `cd`, `ls`, and `head` are essential for navigating the file system and viewing file contents.

## Steps
1. Get the current directory information

   1. Display your working directory.
   2. Display the names of the files and directories in the current working directory.
      
2. Change directory and list the subdirectories

   1. Navigate to the /home/analyst/reports directory.
   2. Display the files and subdirectories in the /home/analyst/reports directory.
  
5. Locate and read the contents of a file

   1. Navigate to the /home/analyst/reports/users directory.
   2. List the files in the current directory.
   3. Display the contents of the Q1_added_users.txt file.

6. Navigate to a directory and locate a file

   1. Navigate to the /home/analyst/logs directory.
   2. Display the name of the file it contains.
   3. Display the first 10 lines of this file.<br>
